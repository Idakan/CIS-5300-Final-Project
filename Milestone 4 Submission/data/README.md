In the data folder, there are 5 different folders that refer to different types of data that we have used in this Milestone.  Please see the descriptions below for a summary on which each folder contains:

bio_paper_data : consists bios and papers for all of our professors. We could not add the training data due to file size constraints. Please access TrainingDataSmall.zip from this link (which you should have access to if you're signed in): https://drive.google.com/file/d/17YDixaHlEz4GYiLQfAQnhJeds3-UBvxp/view?usp=drive_link. 

generated_features_and_professor_data : consists the generated features outputted from our feature generation model and the professor data that we used to construct it

Note: data_professor.csv is the training data we use for the machine learning algorithms

dev_and_test : consists our dev and test set with all of our questions and expected answers

dev_and_test_transformed : consists our transformed dev and test questions into matrix form so that they can be used for machine learning

Note: Both files are our used for predicting a list of professors during machine learning

data_for_feature_analysis : this folder consists data from our last milestone that we used to analyze and make changes for this milestone
