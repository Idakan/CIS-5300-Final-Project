Hey! I’m Liam, a third-year PhD student at the University of Pennsylvania, with the Penn NLP group.
My research focuses primarily on large language models and how humans interact with them. In particular, I am interested in human detection of generated text and whether we can apply those insights to automatic detection systems. I am also interested in the practical application of large language models to education.
My co-authors and I maintain the Real or Fake Text website where people can test how well they can detect generated text. Feel free to try it yourself to test your detection skill!
My previous work has included:
* Analyzing human and automatic detection of generated text
* Automatic Question Generation for “Smart Textbooks”
* Developing low latency End-to-End Speech Translation
