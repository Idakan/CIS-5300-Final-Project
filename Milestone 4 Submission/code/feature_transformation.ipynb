More specifically in the denotational semantics of programming languages and modal logics for distributed systems, as well as zero-knowledge proofs and cryptographic compilers. Prior, I completed by Bachelor's and Masters in MIT EECS, my thesis advisors were Frans Kaashoek and Nickolai Zeldovich. Who would you recommend be my PhD advisor based on my background and interests?\n",
